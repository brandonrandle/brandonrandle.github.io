Today's work from lesson one, part one, exercises two and three of the
<a href="http://www.drawabox.com">Draw a Box</a> lessons - redone with my new
pens. This marks the end of the part one homework. I'll finish up the ellipse
homework with my new pens, then move on to the lesson for part three - boxes.

While things are making sense rationally, they haven't quite settled into my
muscles yet. It's only been a few days after all. I'm looking forward to
assessing my progress after a month to see how things have changed.

Enjoy the scribbles.
