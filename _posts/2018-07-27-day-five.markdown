Today's work from lesson one, part two, exercise one of the
<a href="http://www.drawabox.com">Draw a Box</a> lessons - redone with my new
pens. Still have a bit to finish, as today was quite busy at work.

Drawing from the shoulder is hard. Drawing really small things from the
shoulder is harder. I need a lot more practice.

Enjoy the scribbles.
