I have decided to learn to draw, and, rather than do so in isolation, I will
share my progress with the world at large through this blog.

One may ask as to my motivation for this new hobby: I need something to do with
my hands that does not involve a keyboard and a screen. Being a computer
scientist and having numerous computer-based interests and hobbies means I get
a lot of screen time. I have decided to pursue drawing as a hobby I can do
without a screen and keyboard and without the need for the complex thought
processess necessitated by my usual work.

Essentially, I want to draw to relax and learn something new.

Although there are plentiful resources to use in pursuit of this skill,
I will be following the <a href="http://www.drawabox.com">Draw a Box</a> lessons to
start.

I will be drawing in ink, per the recommendation of Irshad Karim with Draw a
Box, and I will be using a plain sketchbook I bought at Barnes & Noble for my
practice.

My goal is to practice daily, but as life is rarely consistent, there may be
days that are missed. As I practice, I will update this blog with my work.

Time to begin.
