Today's work from lesson one, part two, exercise one of the
<a href="http://www.drawabox.com">Draw a Box</a> lessons - ellipses. For those
who don't know, an ellipse (per Draw a Box) is a circle that has been turned in
3D space. Basically a circle seen from a different angle than straight on. Look
at a quarter from the front and it's a circle - turn it a bit and it's an
ellipse. Turn it all the way to the side and it's a line.

Anyhow, here's my warmup and exercise for today.

Enjoy the scribbles.
