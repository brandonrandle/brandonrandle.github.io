Today's work from lesson one, part two, exercises two and three of the
<a href="http://www.drawabox.com">Draw a Box</a> lessons - ellipses again, but
now inside of planes and funnels. This is surprisingly difficult. I'll need
significant practice to improve these.

On another note, I've been working on drawing without resting any part of my
arm on anything, and I've discovered it to be exceptionally difficult. My
reason for working this way is to avoid the inconsistencies of the resistance
of whatever my appendage rests upon; namely, resting my hand/forearm/elbow
impedes the flow of the movement of my arm. So though it is more difficult,
once the muscles develop properly, I should be much better off.

Enjoy the scribbles.
