Today's work from lesson one, part three, exercise two of the
<a href="http://www.drawabox.com">Draw a Box</a> lessons. This exercise is
similar to the last one, but I'm doing it freehand instead of using a ruler,
I'm only using one vanishing point, and I'm not drawing the perspective lines
all the way back to the vanishng point.

It took me a while to figure out in what order I needed to draw the lines and
how to draw them the proper lengths, but I think I understand now how to go
about it. At this point I just need more practice. Lots more.

Today was the first day using a new sketchbook. I've been using a bound leather
book from Barnes & Noble, and it's been a bit of a hassle between the pages not
laying flat and it being so big and hard to spin around. So I bought an
inexpensive spiral-bound drawing pad from Hobby Lobby, and it is a lot more
enjoyable to use. And as we all should know, the more enjoyable something is to
use, the more likely we are to use it.

Enjoy the scribbles.
