My new pens came in today, so I decided to do some exercises with them. I went
back to the beginning, so from now on I can do the
<a href="http://www.drawabox.com">Draw a Box</a> homework
properly and submit it for review.

The pens are wonderful. They're very smooth and produce quite nice lines. The
ones I ordered are all different sizes (so I could test them out). I'll order
another pack of only the 0.5mm size, since I'll be drawing primarily with it
(and they'll go quickly).

Enjoy the (pens and) scribbles.
