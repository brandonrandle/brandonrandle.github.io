Today's work from lesson one, part one of the
<a href="http://www.drawabox.com">Draw a Box</a> lessons. At this point I'm
simply working through the exercises to develop foundational skills.

As I am awaiting the arrival of my felt-tip pens, I am currently working with
my usual go-to for writing - a Pilot G2 0.38mm black gel pen. Once my new pens
arrive, I will redo the exercises and submit them for review.

Enjoy the scribbles.
