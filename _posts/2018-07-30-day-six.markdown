Today's work from lesson one, part two, exercises two and three of the
<a href="http://www.drawabox.com">Draw a Box</a> lessons - redone with my new
pens. All that is left for lesson one is part three - boxes. I'm looking
forward to starting on them next time.

After two days of no drawing (thanks to the weekend), I was wondering if I'd
fell behind at all. To my surprise, I actually felt the slightest bit of
improvement when it came to drawing lines. Not much, but a little. Who knew
that a week of practice might show some progress.

Enjoy the scribbles.
