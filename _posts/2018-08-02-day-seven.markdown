Today's work from lesson one, part three, exercise one of the
<a href="http://www.drawabox.com">Draw a Box</a> lessons. I'm a couple days
behind on account of work, but I'm back on top of things now.

After a week of doing the Draw a Box program, I'm now actually drawing boxes.
I had fun experimenting with varying the boldness of the lines by changing the
angle of the pen and the amount of pressure I put on it. For the most part, it
was effective. You can see how the boxes stand out a little more. 

I also ended up with a number of smudges and hands covered in ink from going
over the box lines multiple times and not watching where I put my hands. I'll
need to pay more attention next time.

Enjoy the scribbles.
