Last week I began my beekeeping journey when I picked up my first hive
from a local beekeeper. My wife and a friend went with me, and they were rather
wary of the whole thing. They had good reason to be.

We arrived at the beekeeper's apiary after nearly an hour of traversing country
roads. I brought a ratchet strap to help hold the hive together for transport,
and he had the hive ready to go in short order. We loaded the hive into our
car (a Subaru forester) and hit the road.

About twenty minutes into the drive, my friend uttered a quiet yet terrifying
statement: "uh, Brandon...it's leaking bees."

I pulled off the road into a bank parking lot, and we quickly evacuated the
car. Sure enough, the hive had come slightly loose in the back, leaving a
slight crack from which the bees were quickly pouring. I called the beekeeper
and asked him for some suggestions on what to do.

We had two options. Keep going with the bees as-is, or loosen the strap and
push the hive back into position.

We tried the latter. We failed, opening the hive even more such that dozens of
bees came swarming out to visit.

After much hemming and hawing, we decided to press on. My friend and I left my
wife, as she was having no part of being in a car full of bees, and we
continued the forty-five minute drive back to the house. We kept the windows
and sun roof fully open the entire time, and, truth be told, we had few issues.
At one point a bee landed on my face and climbed under my glasses, but,
otherwise, they did not really bother us.

Once we arrived at the house, my friend and I quickly garbed ourselves with
winter caps and towels and gloves. We popped the hive onto a cart and moved it
into position, then fled to the freedom of a bee-less existence. My friend
quickly left, wanting no more to be around bees. I drove back out to fetch my
wife from her place of safety in a grocery store.

The bees are well-settled now, and my fear of them is much less.

Bee Adventurous.
